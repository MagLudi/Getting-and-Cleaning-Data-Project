# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repository is created for the project in the Coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data.

The data for the project (as well as information on what the data is) can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Data files:
All data files are provided within GitHub repository. If the user wants to load the files themselves then they should do the folowing:
    1: create a folder called data in the directory you plan on having run_analysis.R
    2: open https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    3: move all the files in the UCI HAR Dataset folder in the zip file into the folder created in step one

#Running the code and output information:
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. Make sure that the working directory is set to the directory containing run_analysis.R before you run the code.

The file output is called averages.txt. When reading the file, make sure that text wraping is turned off.
